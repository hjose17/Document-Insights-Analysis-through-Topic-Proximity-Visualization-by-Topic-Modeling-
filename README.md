# Document Insights Analysis through Topic Proximity Visualization: A Topic Modeling-Based Approach

This project presents a topic modeling-based approach to analyze document insights and visualize topic proximity, enabling easier interpretation of large text corpora. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, it extracts thematic topics from documents and represents them visually, facilitating insights into how topics relate and cluster together within the corpus.

## Project Overview

Analyzing extensive text datasets often requires not only identifying major themes but also understanding how closely related these themes are. This project leverages topic modeling to uncover latent topics and employs proximity-based visualization techniques to display the relationships between topics, making complex datasets more interpretable.

The project uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify topics and visualizes them using techniques like t-SNE or PCA. The project’s Jupyter Notebook (`ml_pjt.ipynb`) walks through data preprocessing, topic extraction, and visualization.

## Major Modules

The notebook consists of the following key modules:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - **Text Cleaning**: This step involves tokenizing, removing stopwords, lemmatizing, and standardizing the document text to prepare it for analysis.
   - **Text Vectorization**: The cleaned text is transformed into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, which are essential for topic modeling.

### 2. Topic Modeling
   - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: LDA is used to identify clusters of words that represent distinct topics within the document corpus.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: LDA's parameters, such as the number of topics and document-topic distribution, are tuned to optimize topic quality and coherence.
   - **Alternative Models** (if applicable): Other topic modeling algorithms like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) may also be used to compare performance and interpretability.

### 3. Topic Proximity Visualization
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) reduce the topic data to two dimensions for visualization.
   - **Visualization Plotting**: Topics are plotted in a 2D space, showing proximity based on topic similarity. This helps reveal clusters and relationships among topics, making it easier to identify related themes within the corpus.

### 4. Insight Extraction and Analysis
   - **Interpreting Topic Clusters**: The proximity of topics is analyzed to understand the main themes within the document set and how these themes are related.
   - **Document Relevance**: Each document’s relevance to different topics is computed, enabling the identification of dominant themes per document.
   - **Keyword Extraction**: For each topic, key terms are identified to label and interpret topic clusters effectively.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `gensim` (for LDA modeling)

2. **Data Collection**: Load your document corpus into the notebook. This can be a collection of news articles, research papers, or any text dataset.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the `ml_pjt.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
   - Follow the steps to preprocess data, extract topics, and visualize topic proximity.

4. **Adjust Hyperparameters**: Experiment with the number of topics, iterations, and dimensionality reduction parameters to achieve the best insights and visual clarity.

## Project Structure

- **ml_pjt.ipynb**: Main notebook containing code for data processing, topic modeling, and visualization.
- **data/**: Folder to store raw document data.
- **visualizations/**: Folder to save topic proximity visualizations.
- **models/**: Folder for saving trained LDA or NMF models for future use.

## Results

The model outputs:
1. **Identified Topics**: Themes extracted from the document corpus, each represented by a set of keywords.
2. **Topic Proximity Visualization**: A 2D plot showing the proximity of topics to each other, highlighting clusters of related themes.
3. **Topic Relevance in Documents**: Each document’s association with various topics, providing insight into its dominant themes.

## Insights and Interpretation

By analyzing topic proximity and clusters, this project can reveal:
- **Dominant Themes**: Identify the main subjects present in the document corpus.
- **Related Themes**: Recognize how themes are interconnected, highlighting broader areas of interest within the data.
- **Document Categorization**: Group documents based on thematic relevance, aiding in categorizing and retrieving information.

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust framework for analyzing document themes through topic modeling and proximity visualization. By visualizing topic relationships, users can uncover complex thematic structures and gain insights from extensive text datasets.
